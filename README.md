# VirtualReflectometer (VR)
 With VR, you can simulate the basic alignment scans of a basic X ray reflectometer (diffractometer) with a Goebel mirror using ray tracing.
 With this program, you can characterize reflectometers and get a reflectometer-dependent overillumination correction for X Ray Reflectivity (XRR) scans.
 
 VR can be run by code in Matlab or as a standalone app for which the download link and documentation can be found here: !!Link to sourceforge follows soon!!. 
The documentation can be found here: https://github.com/eliashils/VirtualReflectometer/wiki.
